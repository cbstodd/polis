  <p class="static-content">Lowdown was built and is maintained by a fellow Annapolitain. It's an open source project and the code is viewable
    <%= link_to 'here', 'https://github.com/cbstodd/polis', target: '_blank' %>.  The money it takes to
    create and maintain this application comes out of my pocket, so donations are welcome. All donations will
    go to the domain and hosting expenses. We are going to do our best to make sure this app stays
    free, and we are not fond of throwing advertising on the application. So if you find this application helpful we appreciate any donation. </p>
