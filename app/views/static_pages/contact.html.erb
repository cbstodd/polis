  <p class="static-content">Polis was built and is maintained by <%= link_to 'Colper', 'http://www.colinstodd.com', target:'_blank' %> and
    friends. It is an open source project where you can view the
    code <%= link_to 'here', 'https://github.com/cbstodd/polis', target: '_blank' %>. All of the money it takes to
    create and maintain this application comes out of his pocket, so donations are welcome. All and any donations will
    go to the domain and hosting expenses, which gets pricey. We are going to do our best to make sure this app stays
    free, and we are not fond of the advertising idea. So if you find this application helpful we appreciate the
    donation. </p>
